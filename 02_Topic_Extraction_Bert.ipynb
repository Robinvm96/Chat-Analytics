          " Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.",

          " I don’t really know how to say this.",
          " Why would you bring that up right now?",
          " Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it.",
          " Look, there’s something I need to tell you.",
          " Oh, I’m judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don’t owe me an explanation.",
          " It didn’t come up.",
          " So why’d you ask?",
          " Why are you telling me this now?",
          " Well, you wouldn’t have asked me either.",
          " Well, then, tell your face.",
          " I would not.",
          " Yes. There, I said it.",
          " Of course I did. It’s you.",
          " How would you say it?",
          " You didn’t?",
          " You just said yourself, it’s sad.",
          " So, you said you had something to tell me.",
          " And say what? That I didn’t mean it, because I meant it.",
          " Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.",
          " Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?",
          " What am I supposed to say?",
          " Would you rather I didn’t tell you?",
          " No, they said I was too perky.",
          " Trust me, this is the right thing.",
          " Well, you don’t know everything about me.",
          " Why didn’t you tell me?",
          " I thought I said that to you.",
          " Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?",
          " Oh, no. I wish you’d told me that sooner.",
          " Anyway, that’s it. I just thought you should know.",
          " Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…",
          " There’s something I wanted to run past you.",
          " Uh, well, there, there’s one thing I feel I should tell you.",
          " Sure you did.",
          " Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?",
          " No, you told me.",
          " You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.",
          " Oh. You could tell it to me.",
          " Why would I lie?",
          " I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.",
          " Well, you don’t owe me an explanation.",
          " I don’t know what to say.",
          " Why are you asking me?",
          " You’re making fun of me. Forget it.",
          " It doesn’t matter what I say, you’re gonna tell me anyway.",
          " Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?",
          " Yeah, I think I would.",
          " Just say it.",
          " Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can’t believe you did all this.",
          " Just tell me.",
          " Don’t say anything.",
          " He’s at the train station.",
          " All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.",
          " So? He loves trains.",
          " Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing I can do about it.",
          " Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.",
          " Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.",
          " Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?",
          " You’re taking him to Disneyland?",
          " And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.",
          " Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory.",
          " Do not overthink this. (Kisses him, then leads him to her apartment.) ",
          " It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s go get him.",
          " I’m gonna see where he is.",
          " He’s been in bed for two days.",
          " All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.",
          " Thank you for wearing your heels.",
          " Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.",
          " Hmm. Who knows? That’s exciting. I’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here.",
          " I just took him for shoes.",
          " He’s afraid the original owners will come back.",
          " Oh, he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.",
          " Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.",
          " Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.",
          " Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.",
          " He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.",
          " Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.",
          " It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.",
          " Yup. I told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, I’d take him for ice cream.",
          " Thanks. It’s really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.",
          " Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?",
          " So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?",
          " Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.",
          " I didn’t have to take him for ice cream.",
          " Okay, you can take him for shoes.",
          " I know. And it’s not like we’re abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.",
          " Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins.",
          " Yeah, well, next time don’t. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker",
          " Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.",
          " Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.",
          " We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food.",
          " Elves? Come on, Leonard. It’s too early for Lord of the Rings.",
          " I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.",
          " Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.",
          " He’s a musician. He’ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.",
          " Good luck catching a man with that attitude.",
          " His feelings needed to be hurt.",
          " Don’t ask me. A little elf did it.",
          " Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.",
          " No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it.",
          " He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.",
          " Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine. ",
          " What? I don’t want to do that.",
          " You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.",
          " Then what do you need?",
          " Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.",
          " You can’t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?",
          " Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?",
          " Then what do we do?",
          " Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?",
          " Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?",
          " Well, it’s not what I want to do.",
          " Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer.",
          " Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.",
          " See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?",
          " So what do you want to do now?",
          " Okay, let’s do it. You gonna make it?",
          " Is this all stuff you want me to try on?",
          " Oh, no. Oh, you don’t want to do that.",
          " If that’s what you want to do, yes.",
          " I was going to do that.",
          " No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it.",
          " Well, good, because that’s what I did.",
          " You don’t need to do that, it’s okay.",
          " It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it.",
          " So, what do you want to do?",
          " Those things can still happen.",
          " I know exactly what we are gonna do.",
          " Okay, I don’t want this to turn into a fight.",
          " Yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem.",
          " Oh, there’s so much I want to change.",
          " You sure you want to do this?",
          " All right, I really didn’t want to do this, but… here.",
          " You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s just see what else is on.",
          " You don’t have a problem with this, do you?",
          " Can you finish it later?",
          " What, that already happened?",
          " Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.",
          " You changed every word.",
          " I don’t think this is gonna work.",
          " Do or do not. There is no try.",
          " And then what?",
          " Yes. It’s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.",
          " Well what are you gonna do?",
          " No. No, come on, I want to do it.",
          " Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.",
          " Okay, good, ’cause that’s what I want, too.",
          " All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?",
          " This is actually gonna happen.",
          " Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.",
          " That’s weird.",
          " Oh, that’s awful.",
          " You do?",
          " Well, that sucks.",
          " Yeah, that sounds right.",
          " Does that change things?",
          " You were right. ",
          " No. No, no, I do. I do. It’s just, I mean, it’s a really big step.",
          " That’s gross.",
          " It’s just so humiliating.",
          " It’s weird.",
          " No, they’re not.",
          " Yeah, you do that.",
          " Oh, that’s nothing.",
          " Yeah, it kind of does, huh?",
          " It does?",
          " I don’t, either.",
          " No, you don’t.",
          " Yeah, they’re very considerate that way.",
          " You do that?",
          " No that doesn’t sound right either.",
          " So it’s not really like that?",
          " Yeah, he does, but it’s not the same.",
          " I really do.",
          " No, it doesn’t.",
          " Yeah, it’s weird.",
          " It’s the same thing.",
          " Yeah, that’ll slow it down.",
          " You’re sure it’s not weird.",
          " You do?",
          " Oh, yeah. I’m so… oh, that’s terrible.",
          " That’s not true.",
          " That’s a big deal.",
          " I don’t?",
          " Yes, I do.",
          " Does it really say that?",
          " It’s not funny.",
          " You’re right.",
          " No, you don’t.",
          " Oh. Well, you do.",
          " Okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that.",
          " I do, too, but there’s not.",
          " No, I do, and that’s why I hid it.",
          " Can you?",
          " That’s true.",
          " Oh, that’s too bad.",
          " Is that a big deal?",
          " What’s that?",
          " What?",
          " Like what?",
          " What is your point?",
          " What? Here? Now?",
          " What?",
          " On what?",
          " What happened?",
          " Huh. What is this?",
          " What?",
          " Which is?",
          " Why?",
          " What’s this?",
          " What?",
          " Well, what is it?",
          " What?",
          " What?",
          " What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.",
          " What?",
          " What?",
          " What does that mean?",
          " What is that? What is that for?",
          " What?",
          " What?",
          " What?",
          " Why not?",
          " Why?",
          " Why not?",
          " About what?",
          " What?",
          " What?",
          " How?",
          " Well, why?",
          " What is this?",
          " What?",
          " What?",
          " What?",
          " What did he say?",
          " What are you talking about?",
          " What does that mean?",
          " What?",
          " What? Why not?",
          " What?",
          " And you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?",
          " Don’t worry, I won’t look. ",
          " No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.",
          " Well, why were you so angry?",
          " Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I’m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying.",
          " I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.",
          " Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.",
          " I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.",
          " Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.",
          " The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.",
          " So you’re not judging me?",
          " And I’m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.",
          " Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.",
          " Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I’m the super villain Magneto.",
          " Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.",
          " Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both.",
          " Sorry about your car, by the way.",
          " I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!",
          " No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in.",
          " No, of course not. I just feel bad.",
          " Oh, don’t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.",
          " Well, um, I’m just a little thirsty.",
          " I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?",
          " Are you mad at me?",
          " Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.",
          " Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car.",
          " Yes, but I get car sick too, so…",
          " Exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?",
          " I got you a little something to cheer you up.",
          " Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice.",
          " No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.",
          " No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in.",
          " Come on, don’t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.",
          " Well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.",
          " You know what the saddest part was?",
          " Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.",
          " I am not a crybaby.",
          " Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct.",
          " Why are you yelling at me?",
          " Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.",
          " I feel like I want to cry.",
          " I know. You think people are gonna be mad?",
          " Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.",
          " Yes.",
          " That a problem?",
          " Yeah. You got a problem with that?",
          " Yeah. This is crazy.",
          " Yes.",
          " Yeah.",
          " Totally.",
          " Yes. Thank you.",
          " Yes.",
          " Yeah, a couple.",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yeah?",
          " Yes.",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yeah?",
          " Yes?",
          " Yes.",
          " Yeah. Although…",
          " Yep.",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yep. What’s the code?",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yup.",
          " Here?",
          " Absolutely.",
          " Yeah?",
          " So?",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yes.",
          " Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there.",
          " Yeah?",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yeah?",
          " Yeah.",
          " Yeah.",
          " Okay, um, well, there was this girl.",
          " No, but that’s okay. I’ll go talk to her. Want to come with?",
          " Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.",
          " Oh, the girls really did a nice job.",
          " Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.",
          " Um, little bit. (She looks at her watch) What?",
          " What about her?",
          " She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.",
          " She’s a delightful woman. You’ll love her.",
          " She let me.",
          " You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?",
          " Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.",
          " Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.",
          " I just said why, we don’t like her.",
          " Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.",
          " So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?",
          " Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you.",
          " Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?",
          " I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common.",
          " I don’t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?",
          " What do you mean, every time you see her?",
          " So, who’s the girl?",
          " You can’t let her get into your head.",
          " You’re not curious who she’s out with?",
          " And she likes you.",
          " You still see her?",
          " Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.",
          " Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?",
          " Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.",
          " So, who is she?",
          " Hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.",
          " Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her.",
          " Did you feel guilty after kissing her?",
          " Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.",
          " Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.",
          " You work with her? How could you not tell me that?",
          " Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since.",
          " Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…",
          " That is a pencil sharpener.",
          " But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy.",
          " Wow, Hawking. Good for you.",
          " Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I’ll show you. We’ll just put this pencil over here.",
          " I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.",
          " Oh, voodoo’s real. You don’t want to mess with voodoo.",
          " Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really (changes view to solar system) just be information (changes view to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. (Starts the galaxy spinning) So it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.",
          " Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?",
          " Okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.",
          " No, no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.",
          " Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them.",
          " So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?",
          " You know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.",
          " No, no. It’s kind of crazy. I’ve never fooled around in the lab before.",
          " Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.",
          " Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?",
          " You know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!",
          " Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.",
          " On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?",
          " Oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work.",
          " What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh! Wow!",
          " Yeah, I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.",
          " Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?",
          " The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy candy coating.",
          " Well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.",
          " I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.",
          " Oh, what a nice surprise. I don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before.",
          " So, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.",
          " Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.",
          " Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.",
          " Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn’t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.",
          " Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.",
          " Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. (A floating 3D image of the pencil appears. Leonard moves it around with his finger)",
          " No, I do. I didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.",
          " No, it’s a nitrogen laser. It’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.",
          " Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?",
          " Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.",
          " Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.",
          " Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.",
          " You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I’m getting it.",
          " I don’t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.",
          " Oh, that’s nice, but it-it’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I’m not sure how much help you’d be.",
          " Well, so do I, but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?",
          " You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.",
          " All right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s your apartment, too.",
          " You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.",
          " Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… Why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?",
          " Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.",
          " What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.",
          " Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.",
          " Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brother’s coming out here in a few weeks.",
          " I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing.",
          " Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools.",
          " Well, you and I would get our own room, right?",
          " And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how’s the detector going?",
          " If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your… your only tie?",
          " Is your brother out of prison?",
          " I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.",
          " Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work.",
          " Oh, come on, that’s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.",
          " And our butts. Not hanging it.",
          " Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What’s going on with your brother?",
          " So, where do we want to hang it?",
          " No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.",
          " Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours.",
          " Of course not. I mean, he’s your brother.",
          " You hung in there, though.",
          " Oh, that is so thoughtful.",
          " Oh. Oh. Thank you.",
          " Whoa! That’s heavy.",
          " Ooh, this one looks nice.",
          " Oh, wow, that’s so sweet. Hey, what’s this?",
          " That’s great. That shows a lot of integrity.",
          " Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.",
          " Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.",
          " Wow. That is amazing.",
          " This is great. It, thank you, it’s, so much.",
          " Wow. That’s rough.",
          " This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?",
          " It’s great. I love it.",
          " You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.",
          " It’s actually pretty neat.",
          " It is freaking amazing.",
          " Wow, where did you learn these moves?",
          " That one? Damn right I like that one.",
          " Wow, you remember that?",
          " Wow.",
          " Whoa! That is very cool.",
          " Oh, wow.",
          " You know what, that’s great. I love that.",
          " Oh, it’s beautiful.",
          " I liked it. I’m excited.",
          " Couple of weeks.",
          " I, I’m not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job, then who knows?",
          " Don’t worry, we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. It’s like an all-night party. There’s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, it’s off the chain mail.",
          " Almost 1am.",
          " Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.",
          " It’s six thirty in the morning.",
          " Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it’s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.",
          " That sounds fun. When’s it start?",
          " When is it?",
          " Oh, before I forget, Saturday I’m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.",
          " A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.",
          " Three, four months.",
          " Whoa. When would you leave?",
          " Well, how long?",
          " Really? That’s how you’re gonna spend your Saturday night?",
          " Night.",
          " Well, the night is still young.",
          " Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.",
          " They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.",
          " Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?",
          " Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?",
          " Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it.",
          " Thirty feet.",
          " Midnight.",
          " He tried to take nude photos of you?",
          " Did he pay you back?",
          " Well, maybe you should tell him.",
          " Come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you.",
          " Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.",
          " No, he’s not. We’re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.",
          " Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?",
          " Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?",
          " Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I’m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You’re not really considering working for him, are you?",
          " He can never know that I gave that to you.",
          " Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?",
          " Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.",
          " Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?",
          " No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.",
          " Did your boyfriend make you type that?",
          " Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.",
          " It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.",
          " Listen, don’t worry. I’ll talk to him.",
          " What? He loves you, okay? And he’s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective… I swear I know it.",
          " Not only is he still not talking to me, but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put’s fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I’m still a fun guy!”",
          " Screw him. You’re fine.",
          " Yeah, probably.",
          " Yeah, of course, why?",
          " Sometimes.",
          " So what do you think?",
          " On the one hand, if I say yes…",
          " I would hope so.",
          " Of course.",
          " Um, I think so. Why?",
          " I guess.",
          " I don’t think so.",
          " I hope so.",
          " I guess.",
          " I guess not.",
          " Oh, I’ll probably say yes.",
          " Yeah, probably.",
          " Yeah, I think so.",
          " Maybe.",
          " Yeah, I guess.",
          " Yeah. I guess.",
          " No, but he will.",
          " It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.",
          " I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking.",
          " I did like that he had the weather on it.",
          " I know, but you did throw up. Isn’t that a sign of a concussion?",
          " He was drunk.",
          " Yeah, I don’t think the water was really boiling.",
          " It’s like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn’t want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.",
          " No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich’ed him.",
          " I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick.",
          " I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it.",
          " You can hear my toilet flush?",
          " This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.",
          " I’m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.",
          " The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.",
          " I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world. (Penny vomits in sink) Are you okay? (Vomits in toilet again)",
          " This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.",
          " It was the heat of the moment.",
          " Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.",
          " Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.",
          " Really?",
          " Really?",
          " Really?",
          " Really? Here?",
          " Really? Never?",
          " Do you really mean that?",
          " Really? You guess you’re in?",
          " Really?",
          " Really?",
          " Really? This one?",
          " Really?",
          " Really?",
          " Really?",
          " Really? Why?",
          " Really?",
          " Really?",
          " Really? Why would you say that?",
          " Okay, whatever.",
          " Okay.",
          " Okay.",
          " Okay.",
          " Okay.",
          " Okay.",
          " Okay.",
          " Okay, I was just checking.",
          " Okay, I get it.",
          " Okay. Good.",
          " This is for you.",
          " Okay. Have fun.",
          " Well…",
          " Okay.",
          " Okay.",
          " Okay, like what?",
          " Okay.",
          " Hi.",
          " Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.",
          " Hi. ",
          " Hi.",
          " Yes, please.",
          " Hi.",
          " I just thought I’d stop by and say hello.",
          " Hi.",
          " Oh, hi.",
          " Smile.",
          " Hi. Sure.",
          " Sure.",
          " Hi.",
          " Oh, hi.",
          " Sure.",
          " Sure.",
          " Sure.",
          " Hey.",
          " Hey.",
          " Hey.",
          " Both of us.",
          " Hey, you.",
          " Hey.",
          " Oh hey.",
          " Hey.",
          " Hey.",
          " Hey.",
          " Hey.",
          " Hey!",
          " Hey.",
          " Hey.",
          " Hey.",
          " Hey.",
          " Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom’s book?",
          " Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?",
          " No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.",
          " Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.",
          " It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.",
          " Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.",
          " No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.",
          " All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?",
          " Seriously, please find another book.",
          " I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?",
          " No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.",
          " Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.",
          " You bought my mom’s book?",
          " You know me, I’m a big ol’ bookworm.",
          " It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.",
          " Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see.",
          " Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.",
          " This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.",
          " Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.",
          " I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.",
          " I hate those movies.",
          " Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.",
          " Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.",
          " Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she’s not building a dam.",
          " Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.",
          " It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.",
          " You pick plenty of movies.",
          " But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.",
          " So it’s a family film.",
          " No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.",
          " A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.",
          " I’m the one who thought of it.",
          " You saying I don’t have an open mind?",
          " You think about dying?",
          " I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.",
          " Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.",
          " I thought it’d be a little more, just more.",
          " You know, can I ask you a question?",
          " I was thinking here with you.",
          " You could be a little more into it.",
          " I just thought of one more.",
          " You’re overthinking this.",
          " I do have to ask you one favour.",
          " Are you out of your mind?!",
          " Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.",
          " Okay, Merry Christmas.",
          " Sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Never mind, we’re cool.",
          " I’m sorry?",
          " Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry.",
          " It doesn’t matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.",
          " All right, well I’ll see you later.",
          " Okay, come with me.",
          " It’s okay.",
          " Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you.",
          " You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll….",
          " I’m sorry. Just, just give me another chance.",
          " Okay, really, I’m fine.",
          " I’m sorry, go ahead.",
          " It’s a little late, but I’ll take it.",
          " Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from.",
          " That is the sickest thing I’ve ever heard.",
          " Oh, my God.",
          " Oh, my God.",
          " Oh, my God.",
          " Oh, my God, yes.",
          " Oh, my God, you still go left.",
          " Oh, and the fairy tale continues.",
          " Oh, my God. What a day.",
          " Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.",
          " Oh, God.",
          " Oh, my God. What happened?",
          " Oh, thank God.",
          " Oh, my God, I am the worst.",
          " No.",
          " No.",
          " Nope.",
          " No.",
          " Not really, no.",
          " No.",
          " No?",
          " Then no.",
          " No.",
          " No.",
          " No. Why?",
          " Nope.",
          " Nope, never.",
          " Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football.",
          " No talking.",
          " You want to talk?",
          " So, you’re okay talking about this?",
          " Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys.",
          " Say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.",
          " Who you talking to?",
          " Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t",
          " Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question.",
          " Okay, I don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.",
          " Okay, that’s enough. Stop talking.",
          " See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.",
          " Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first. ",
          " Thank you.",
          " Thank you. You look very nice.",
          " Thank you.",
          " Thank you. So do you. ",
          " Nicely done.",
          " Thank you.",
          " Thanks.",
          " Thank you.",
          " Thank you.",
          " Oh. Done and done.",
          " Okay. Thanks. ",
          " Thank you.",
          "  Thank you.",
          " Come on.",
          " Come on, be serious.",
          " Oh, come on, don’t be like that.",
          " No, come on. This is serious.",
          " Ha-ha, don’t push it.",
          " Oh, come on, you know that’s not true.",
          " Don’t be like that.",
          " Okay, come on, that’s not fair.",
          " Glaringly obvious. Go on.",
          " Come on, be serious.",
          " Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?",
          " I’m nosy. See ya.",
          " So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?",
          " Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.",
          " Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…",
          " Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.",
          " Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?",
          " Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…",
          " No, I’m not shy.",
          " Oh, are you shy? ",
          " Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?",
          " Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.",
          " That’s not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That’s all you.",
          " Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor’s black, so I’m pretty sure that’s the right answer.",
          " Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?",
          " So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?",
          " Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.",
          " It’s really good. We’ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.",
          " Aw, I got a little paper cut.",
          " Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.",
          " Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.",
          " How can reading my journal be an accident?",
          " Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.",
          " Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?",
          " Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.",
          " Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?",
          " You did not just quote an Nsync song.",
          " Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.",
          " OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars. I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?",
          " I’d love it if my dad could come.",
          " I’m glad to hear it.",
          " May what?",
          " Hey. You ready to go?",
          " Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.",
          " What’s two to one?",
          " So we don’t tell people we’re back together?",
          " Oh. ",
          " That doesn’t seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?",
          " Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”",
          " Like who?",
          " Right. No surprises.",
          " All right, got it. Is there anything else?",
          " Wow. Can they?",
          " Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?",
          " Did you just quote Star Wars?",
          " I told you not to do the worm.",
          " Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?",
          " Oh.",
          " Move out.",
          " Good, good. And then what?",
          " Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you’re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.",
          " Well, who’d you go with?",
          " A little mood lighting, huh?",
          " Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?",
          " Little bit, yeah.",
          " Well, remember Kurt?",
          " You’re making it a big deal.",
          " That’s what you took from that? The guy is married!",
          " Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.",
          " You’re kidding.",
          " Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.",
          " Well, I’ve had it. I am done. I can’t, I can’t live with him for one more minute.",
          " It is, isn’t it?",
          " Mm, not really.",
          " The… the eighth grade?",
          " So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.",
          " Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?",
          " No, no, I’m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers.",
          " Yeah, sorry.",
          " come on in.",
          " You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.",
          " It’s not working.",
          " Yeah, I guess you’re right.",
          " Uh, yeah.",
          " Who’s that?",
          " Why do you think I’d be like that? I get it, you’re taking one class. It’s nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.",
          " Fine, I’ll go over there tomorrow.",
          " Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.",
          " I’m okay.",
          " Sure you have.",
          " So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?",
          " You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?",
          " Oh, I know. This might help.",
          " Good night.",
          " Okay, well, that’s really cool of you.",
          " Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public.",
          " Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort.",
          " Oh. Then I guess I’m in.",
          " Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.",
          " Yeah, it was.",
          " So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?",
          " Aw, I know I wasn’t into this before, but I’m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.",
          " Well, that was fun.",
          " No, I’m not.",
          " I have feelings for you.",
          " Ooh.",
          " All right.",
          " I got your back.",
          " Smooth.",
          " No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.",
          " Not really.",
          " Well, good for you.",
          " It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.",
          " Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you stop?",
          " See, that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I had. But then I realized I’m passionate about you.",
          " Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.",
          " Well, it’s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be.",
          " You two want to be alone?",
          " Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.",
          " Oh, nice. ",
          " It’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.",
          " Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.",
          " He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question it.",
          " Nothing really. It was just kissing.",
          " She’d be proud, huh?",
          " I can’t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.",
          " That’d be great. Thank you.",
          " Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.",
          " Did you guys do it?",
          " And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?",
          " I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?",
          " The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.",
          " Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!",
          " Yeah. Okay, all right, don’t freak out. You can make this work.",
          " Oh, God, no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.",
          " Nevertheless, I’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.",
          " Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.",
          " Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What’s, what’s that?",
          " It’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.",
          " Oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.",
          " Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too.",
          " There we go.",
          " Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.",
          " You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.",
          " You know your friend Stuart?",
          " Well, I sell pharmaceuticals. That’s just a really hard to spell word for drugs.",
          " Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.",
          " TV star.",
          " Mmm.",
          " I can’t do it with you staring at me.",
          " Okay. Here goes.",
          " It is. It is about us.",
          " Well, we did it.",
          " Well, uh, the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!",
          " Okay, let’s go see your psychic.",
          " Well, you don’t know that.",
          " Why should I worry?",
          " Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I’m gonna go right. Don’t make a big deal out of it.",
          " That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea.",
          " So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.",
          " Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?",
          " What if I dump you?",
          " No. We just made out a little.",
          " Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn’t have to be dating someone who’s only a waitress.",
          " They don’t, that’s why I saved this one. ",
          " I don’t know, it’s complicated.",
          " Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.",
          " Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.",
          " Yeah, you got it.",
          " You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.",
          " And then the, the subject got changed somehow.",
          " Very funny.",
          " Well, it’s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.",
          " Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.",
          " What good is it if you don’t use it?",
          " So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.",
          " Right.",
          " It’s just the four digits, month and day.",
          " What? Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?",
          " It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.",
          " I’m listening.",
          " Yeah. When I didn’t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.",
          " So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.",
          " Unbelievable. (Goes to door)",
          " Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!",
          " Just answer the phone.",
          " Are you actually gonna dance?",
          " Okay, it’s not me, right? This script is terrible.",
          " Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I’ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.",
          " Get out.",
          " Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.",
          " I don’t want you to make a big deal out of it.",
          " I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before.",
          " Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.",
          " I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.",
          " Having a little trouble catching your breath there?",
          " So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you.",
          " You used to it yet?",
          " ‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?",
          " Did not know that.",
          " So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.",
          " Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Here’s the hotel room we all share. ",
          " Won’t make us any younger.",
          " Well, I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking.",
          " I’m not gonna schmooze anybody. I’m gonna let my work speak for itself.",
          " Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?",
          " What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.",
          " You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.",
          " Is that a pregnancy test?",
          " Okay. (Reading) Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?",
          " Can I take a look?",
          " Trying to paint a picture.",
          " Why does it have to get weird?",
          " I’m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to!",
          " Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.",
          " Sorry. Maybe next year. I’m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let’s have sex. Waugh!",
          " Yeah, bitches are the worst.",
          " You’re kidding, right?",
          " Oh. That’s great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?",
          " Oh, don’t say cute. That’s the worst.",
          " Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.",
          " No, I meant that as a regret.",
          " Great.",
          " Oh, thank you, but I’m okay.",
          " Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.",
          " Uh.",
          " Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.",
          " Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.",
          " This is just something you usually do together, and if I’m screwing it up, I don’t have to go.",
          " You mean, like a pinky swear?",
          " Yeah, that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I’ve got some good news.",
          " Well, it just wasn’t the right time.",
          " Hmm?",
          " That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?",
          " Right. Sorry.",
          " No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.",
          " Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.",
          " You’re a good friend.",
          " I’m sorry, I was thinking about work.",
          " Oh. Well, that’s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.",
          " Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie.",
          " I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that.",
          " Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?",
          " Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?",
          " Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.",
          " That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me.",
          " Right. Sorry, sorry.",
          " I don’t care. We’ll make our own music.",
          " Oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there.",
          " Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn’t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?",
          " Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while.",
          " Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.",
          " Because you are giving your commencement speech.",
          " Just open it.",
          " No. Look, this has to stop.",
          " You know what, why don’t you just do it? You’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?",
          " It’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?",
          " Well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.",
          " Great.",
          " Yeah, there is.",
          " It’s open.",
          " Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would’ve asked you to dance.",
          " It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.",
          " Well, that is the grown-up thing.",
          " No. Sulfites. Migraines.",
          " You don’t know my birthday, do you?",
          " Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.",
          " You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.",
          " Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?",
          " I made an eight o’clock reservation.",
          " Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.",
          " No, no, I’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding.",
          " So, Polly, tell me about yourself.",
          " Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.",
          " Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don’t want you to be uncomfortable. ",
          " Oh, hey.",
          " Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?",
          " See? Right there. You’re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t, but one problem at a time.",
          " How did you get paint in your eye?",
          " Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?",
          " Hey, you got a minute?",
          " Mm-hmm.",
          " Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.",
          " D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.",
          " Baby.",
          " You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.",
          " Oh, that means so much. I love you.",
          " Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.",
          " Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.",
          " Good. Glad is good.",
          " Sweetie, you are grown up.",
          " I know, but…",
          " Well, get it. Get it for me.",
          " Joke all you want, but you think about it.",
          " Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?",
          " You okay? You seem a little distracted.",
          " Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things.",
          " No, I’m into it, I’m into it. Just, there’s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.",
          " This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.",
          " Okay, now this time…",
          " You’re right. Just forget it.",
          " Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?",
          " My God, who’s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.",
          " Come here.",
          " Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?",
          " What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went.",
          " Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t.",
          " Why? What are you afraid of?",
          " Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store.",
          " Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?",
          " I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.",
          " Inevitable, you say?",
          " What else can you do? Move back in with him?",
          " Yeah, I wanted to explain.",
          " Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait.",
          " Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.",
          " I know, I know.",
          " Hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, I’d keep it moving.",
          " You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.",
          " Nice.",
          " She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.",
          " Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.",
          " It’s okay if you say no.",
          " Hmm.",
          " Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It’s where all the vendors and exhibits are.",
          " I love you, too.",
          " I turn into a bear?",
          " I don’t know.",
          " Well, there was a lot at stake.",
          " Yeah, I know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way.",
          " No. He can’t afford his apartment, and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean.",
          " Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.",
          " What, is it secret?",
          " Oh, good, you heard me.",
          " The one I gave you?",
          " I have a confession to make.",
          " Oh, um, I, I can come back.",
          " You’re a hero.",
          " Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.",
          " Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.",
          " No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us.",
          " Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.",
          " Nice try. NSYNC forever.",
          " Great. I’ll go get my stuff.",
          " I love you, too.",
          " Aw.",
          " Can I get you anything?",
          " Thank you. Finally, there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me.",
          null,
          " Hey, you got a minute?",
          " Well, come on, he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He’s fine.",
          " Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.",
          " ‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go.",
          " What did you do?",
          " Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?",
          " Honestly? It’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about.",
          " How about that? I finally caught a break.",
          " All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here.",
          " Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?",
          " No, I know. It’s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.",
          " I hate this guy.",
          " Over puppets?",
          " I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.",
          " You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s.",
          " No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re right, it’s the best.",
          " Did she think you were choking or… I’m sorry, that’s great. Thank you for spending time with her.",
          " You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn’t want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.",
          " I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.",
          " Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.",
          " Hey. Penny, don’t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.",
          " Good morning, sunshine.",
          " What about my robot poster?",
          " Of course not.",
          " No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me.",
          " Oh. Yeah, okay.",
          " What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?",
          " In confidence!",
          " Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight.",
          " Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.",
          " Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?",
          " Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.",
          " Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it.",
          " My last growth spurt. ",
          " What do you want from me?",
          " My head, what about yours?",
          " All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.",
          " Okay, you’re kind of really great.",
          " You don’t know your own husband’s birthday.",
          " Oh, cool. Are there pictures?",
          " Was there a plan B?",
          " You’re kidding.",
          " Telephone wires can’t electrocute you, can they?",
          " Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.",
          " You had sex, didn’t you?",
          " Yeah. You’re gonna be on Skype, they’re not gonna see your legs.",
          " Okay, well, let’s just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.",
          " Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.",
          " I know. I feel so grown up.",
          " One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.",
          " Spaghetti okay?",
          " In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.",
          " Sorry. Whatever. It’s all good.",
          " Did you get the part?",
          " Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.",
          " What are you worried about?",
          " Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?",
          " You know what, you don’t have to give me this. You keep it.",
          " You, you stupid Pop-Tart.",
          " Oh.",
          " Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.",
          " Sorry.",
          " Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?",
          " Face it, you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…",
          " Well, I am.",
          " Yeah, kind of, yeah.",
          " Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?",
          " Well, then have the robot go and get him.",
          " Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets.",
          " What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?",
          " We gotta get her to a vet right now.",
          " I know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s nothing to see, well, not nothing….",
          " With your career?",
          " Hmm.",
          " Okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.",
          " Okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?",
          " Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.",
          " Smoother than you.",
          " And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.",
          " I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.",
          " Huh.",
          " So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.",
          " It’s open.",
          " Oh, my. It’s not a contest.",
          " Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff.",
          " Control issues?",
          " I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.",
          " You sure?",
          " I got asked to sign autographs there.",
          " And stop apologizing all the time.",
          " No. I need to start making some smart decisions.",
          " Well, yeah.",
          " Uh-huh. ",
          " Well, I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.",
          " You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?",
          " Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.",
          " Hmm.",
          " Yes, you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants.",
          " Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?",
          " I’m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?",
          " Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?",
          " I quoted your favourite Nsync song.",
          " I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking",
          " No, no, it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful.",
          " Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.",
          " You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.",
          " Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.",
          " Uh-huh.",
          " So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?",
          " Are you sure?",
          " Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.",
          " Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.",
          " Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?",
          " Oh, rose petals.",
          " Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about.",
          " You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.",
          " I love you.",
          " Huh.",
          " I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet.",
          " Yeah, me, too.",
          " Hmm?",
          " Oh, what a jerk.",
          " I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.",
          " Uh-huh.",
          " You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble.",
          " You are so funny.",
          " No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.",
          " Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.",
          " No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It’s not easy. You try it.",
          " All the time.",
          " Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?",
          " What’s wrong with cute?",
          " Oh, that’s not who I am.",
          " You wanted to meet my friends.",
          " Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why.",
          " Well, can we get on another airline?",
          " I don’t know.",
          " Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here’s the thing, I’m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me.",
          " Oh, yeah.",
          " Oh, I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me.",
          " Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?",
          " He’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? The guy is devastated.",
          " Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?",
          " Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?",
          " Yeah. It’s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great.",
          " Aw, is this your first time?",
          " Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?",
          " See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.",
          " All right.",
          " Good, good. You?",
          " Oh, no, it’s fine, you got most of it out the window. ",
          " All right, fine.",
          " Damn it.",
          " Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn’t speak again until middle school.",
          " Are you sure?",
          " That’s great.",
          " No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.",
          " Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.",
          " Yeah, sure, come on in.",
          " Oh, she’s a doctor.",
          " You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.",
          " Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.",
          " Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.",
          " No, I don’t need any fish nibbling my business.",
          " The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.",
          " Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won’t get mad. I don’t like it after sex, and I don’t like it now.",
          " So, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?",
          " Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?",
          " Uh.",
          " Oh, yeah, no, I, I’m, I’m glad.",
          " What’s the problem with Goofy?",
          " Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.",
          " Yes. We’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I’m not doing that either. (Receives text) Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight’s been cancelled.",
          " You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.",
          " Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?",
          " Oh, well, then you, you do it.",
          " I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.",
          " I’m sorry I called it cute. Let’s watch another one.",
          " Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.",
          " Oh, pthththth.",
          " It was cute.",
          " Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.",
          " ‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?",
          " Please don’t be upset. I just, I didn’t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.",
          " I was hoping we could talk about the money again.",
          " No, I know you’ll try, but it’ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I’m just gonna stay where I’m at for now.",
          " And it’s the happiest day of our lives.",
          " A hugging machine?",
          " Okay. Thank you, you’re the best. Mm.",
          " Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.",
          " They have them every week.",
          " Uh-huh.",
          " Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.",
          " Ha, I knew you weren’t asleep.",
          " Okay, let’s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.",
          " Wow.",
          " Really? Are you sure about that?",
          " Well, do you know anybody?",
          " I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.",
          " Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.",
          " Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?",
          " Toy Story 3?",
          " Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.",
          " Is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint?",
          " Are you sure? I could pretend I’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni.",
          " What do I mean? Boy, that’s a toughie.",
          " Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it.",
          " It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker, I’d just been seasick.",
          " I can’t believe you kept this.",
          " You’re kidding.",
          " By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.",
          " No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.",
          " Doesn’t sound that bad.",
          " She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.",
          " Oh, great. We’re still dating, right?",
          " Well, glad you’re feeling better.",
          " The robot didn’t hurt his feelings.",
          " Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me.",
          " And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go.",
          " What would you regret?",
          " I’m not saying that.",
          " All right, cool. I think you’ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.",
          " I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.",
          " Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.",
          " What if they call our names?",
          " Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?",
          " Yeah, I know. I’m a total bitch.",
          " There’s no music.",
          " Hmm?",
          " The Harmony One was fine. We didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.",
          " Wow. Well done.",
          " Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.",
          " I need you to apologize to How…",
          " Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us.",
          " It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it’s different.",
          " I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.",
          " Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.",
          " That candle and you.",
          " I’m sorry, what did I say?",
          " Great, be right back.",
          " Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?",
          " That sounds like fun.",
          " Well, that depends.",
          " I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.",
          " No, it’s not. Always made it worse.",
          " The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.",
          " Well, I’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he’ll stay?",
          " God, I love you. I love you so much.",
          " Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?",
          " Are you sure you don’t want to go to the emergency room?",
          " You’re right. I’m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?",
          " Yeah, that scares me, too.",
          " I am.",
          " I’m listening.",
          " No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.",
          " I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.",
          " Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun.",
          " Good. (He grabs her and kisses her.) ",
          " Fine, you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just have a nice time?",
          " Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.",
          " Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it’s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie.",
          " Uh, keep your mouth off other women.",
          " Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.",
          " Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?",
          " So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?",
          " I know.",
          " Oh, good, I guessed right.",
          " Okay, good night, sweetie.",
          " Come on, it’s Christmas, just give me this one.",
          " I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?",
          " So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?",
          " Another football game?",
          " Me, too.",
          " I don’t understand.",
          " Yes, you are. You always overthink things.",
          " Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.",
          " You’re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?",
          " What? I didn’t know you had a journal.",
          " No. No woman would.",
          " I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.",
          " My birthday.",
          " Really? That’s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.",
          " It’ll be fine, let’s just go.",
          " About Stuart? Love to.",
          " Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.",
          " Oh, you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him since the divorce.",
          " Seems a shame to throw it away.",
          " Well, then who?",
          " It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.",
          " Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.",
          " He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?",
          " Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.",
          " I’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why.",
          " Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?",
          " Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even know what TJ stands for.",
          " No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.",
          " Yeah, that was the point of the story.",
          " Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.",
          " I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.",
          " Great.",
          " Oh, just this guy I met at school.",
          " I know. I thought we’d take yours.",
          " Okay, listen, there’s something I need to tell you. I’ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.",
          " That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?",
          " I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.",
          " Uh-huh.",
          " That is not the definition of professional.",
          " No, she doesn’t.",
          " Mm.",
          " Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.",
          " Well, it creeps me out.",
          " Well, you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.",
          " Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.",
          " I thought you grew up on a farm.",
          " I know, and I’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this.",
          " No, this is stuff I want you to throw out. ",
          " I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.",
          " Well, um, on one level, really, really well.",
          " No, stop being stupid.",
          " Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.",
          " I’m sorry. I was just trying to help.",
          " Sure, anything.",
          " No, no, no, no, you’re, you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it’s fine, I’ll just, I’ll suck it up.",
          " Well, what was the plan?",
          " Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.",
          " I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.",
          " Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.",
          " Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?",
          " I don’t understand.",
          " Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.",
          " Short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse.",
          " Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead.",
          " Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.",
          " Mm-hmm. Hmm.",
          " Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.",
          " Aaargh.",
          " Oh, yes.",
          " Did they make a movie about it?",
          " Well, for starters, I wouldn’t eat the bananas.",
          " Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.",
          " Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?",
          " Well, have fun tonight.",
          " Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?",
          " How long have you had this secret account?",
          " Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.",
          " Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?",
          " See, that wasn’t so bad. He even picked up the check.",
          " I can’t say.",
          " No, she had dental insurance.",
          " Well, how much you got in there?",
          " Oh, would you stop worrying about that?",
          " Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them.",
          " Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.",
          " You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?",
          " Hit me.",
          " May.",
          " I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying.",
          " Are you really that kind of guy?",
          " Get out!",
          " There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it.",
          " Oh, that is so sad.",
          " Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.",
          " You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman. ",
          " Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.",
          " Yeah. Okay, listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.",
          " You know, I believe in ghosts, too.",
          " You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.",
          " I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.",
          " My father used to borrow it.",
          " That sounds nice. Yeah.",
          " The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.",
          " Hey, you got a sec?",
          " You’re so butch.",
          " I know. Thank you.",
          " Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.",
          " Well, you’re, you’re right. Let’s just go.",
          " I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.",
          " Sign right there.",
          " All right. Let’s just finish cooking.",
          " Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.",
          " I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.",
          " With my life.",
          " Okay, but earlier it seemed like…",
          " It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.",
          " Sorry.",
          " You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.",
          " We sure did.",
          " I’ve never been to a funeral before.",
          " Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?",
          " So, what did you think of your first funeral?",
          " Okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!",
          " Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?",
          " Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.",
          " Okay, I’m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?",
          " I don’t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.",
          " And no regrets.",
          " And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.",
          " No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough.",
          " My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.",
          " No, it’s like that. Well, I’m excited to show you around.",
          " That sounds nice.",
          " Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade. ",
          " Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn’t save them all.",
          " Really? ‘Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.",
          " Just kissing.",
          " Oh, then you all can get tenure.",
          " Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?",
          " To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.",
          " It was before my growth spurt.",
          " No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.",
          " Your ex-boyfriend?",
          " Good.",
          " Hmm.",
          " Oh.",
          " Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?",
          " Did you feel guilty?",
          " All right, then break it off with the new girl.",
          " Go! Wow."

          " Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?",
          " Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.",
          " No, the pants that Stephanie got me.",
          " A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?",

          " No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.",
          " I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?",
          " No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?",
          " And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.",
          " It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.",
          " Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?",
          " Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing.",
          " I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and I’ve been really happy.",
          " Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?",
          " Will you be my valentine?",
          " I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.",
          " Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?",
          " Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.",
          " Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.",
          " You’re an even better husband.",
          " What do you mean, why? It’s Valentine’s Day.",
          " Well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.",
          " Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it.",
          " Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever.",
          " I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.",
          " I don’t know. We could get married.",
          " Geez, what a fun couple.",
          " No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.",
          " Well, you know, It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it’s like a secret that I could never keep.",
          " Because we love each other.",
          " So, we’re still getting married?",

          " Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I’d hate to do anything that screws that up.",
          " And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?",
          " Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it?",
          " Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?",
          " What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?",
          " Is it? We’re together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?",
          " Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.",
          " Wow, there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in.",
          " Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.",
          " Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?",
          " Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…",
          " No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.",
          " I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.",
          " This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?",
          " Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?",
          " But it’s an expression of our love.",
          " Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.",
          " That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.",
          " So is that it? Are, are we engaged?",
          " Obviously, I have some commitment issues.",
          " Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?",
          " Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.",
          " Wait, we’re gonna get married again?",
          " Wow. It sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.",
          " So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?",
          " Well, that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.",
          " Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret.",
          " Well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding.",

          " Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can’t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.",
          " Well, I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you.",
          " So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.",
          " She said shush. I should have shushed. (Enters apartment. Sheldon and Beverley are inside duetting on Journey’s “Any Way You Want It” on Rock Star.)",
          " That’s it. It’s Sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night.",
          " I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.",
          " So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?",
          " No, not at all. No, it’s, it’s great. It’s terrific. I, you know, I just can’t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how’s he going to get by without you? Ernie.",
          " No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.",
          " No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.",
          " With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?",
          " Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.",
          " I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?",
          " Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine.",
          " You work with Sheldon, you tell me.",
          " Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?",
          " Yeah. Well, Sheldon’s not here.",
          " Oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn’t wait, you know? I’ve got you, I’ve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.",
          " Hey, Sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.",
          " Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?",
          " No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy. ",
          " Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.",
          " Oh, I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me.",
          " Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.",
          " So, how’s it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other? ",
          " Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.",
          " Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him.",
          " Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?",
          " Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?",
          " I used Sheldon’s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.",
          " Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.",
          " I guess. I’m just, you know, worried about Sheldon.",
          " I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.",
          " Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.",
          " The hair products are Sheldon’s.",
          " I found these in the dryer. I’m assuming they belong to Sheldon.",
          " Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone.",
          " Wait, Sheldon’s going to be there? We all promised we weren’t going to go.",

          " You don’t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.",

I just, i can\\u2019t believe you did all this.\",\" Just tell me.\",\" Don\\u2019t say anything.\",\" He\\u2019s at the train station.\",\" All right. But let me know if you\\u2019re going to stuff him with junk food. I don\\u2019t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.\",\" So? He loves trains.\",\" Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there\\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\",\" Whoa, that\\u2019s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.\",\" Yeah. But now he\\u2019s happy to let people think he\\u2019s responsible for everything.\",\" Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?\",\" You\\u2019re taking him to Disneyland?\",\" And don\\u2019t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He\\u2019ll say he can handle it, but I promise you\\u2019ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.\",\" Uh, he\\u2019s not gonna be there. He\\u2019s just sending a team to research his theory.\",\" Do not overthink this. (Kisses him, then leads him to her apartment.) \",\" It\\u2019s dark out and he\\u2019s alone, I don\\u2019t like it. Let\\u2019s go get him.\",\" I\\u2019m gonna see where he is.\",\" He\\u2019s been in bed for two days.\",\" All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren\\u2019t so tall. We wouldn\\u2019t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.\",\" Thank you for wearing your heels.\",\" Yeah, let\\u2019s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.\",\" Hmm. Who knows? That\\u2019s exciting. I\\u2019ll get to wake up every morning and see if he\\u2019s still here.\",\" I just took him for shoes.\",\" He\\u2019s afraid the original owners will come back.\",\" Oh, he\\u2019s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.\",\" Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.\",\" Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.\",\" Okay. I\\u2019m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.\",\" He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.\",\" Yeah, we won\\u2019t be eating Arthur tonight.\",\" It\\u2019s sweet how you look out for him. You\\u2019re a good guy.\",\" Yup. I told him if he didn\\u2019t bite the hygienist, I\\u2019d take him for ice cream.\",\" Thanks. It\\u2019s really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I\\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.\",\" Does this sound familiar? I\\u2019d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn\\u2019t?\",\" So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn\\u2019t sleep on your couch?\",\" Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.\",\" I didn\\u2019t have to take him for ice cream.\",\" Okay, you can take him for shoes.\",\" I know. And it\\u2019s not like we\\u2019re abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.\",\" Sweetie, every night you don\\u2019t kill him in his sleep, he wins.\",\" Yeah, well, next time don\\u2019t. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker\",\" Oh, I\\u2019m sure he\\u2019s fine.\",\" Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.\",\" We\\u2019re going to Disneyland. He\\u2019s going to eat junk food.\",\" Elves? Come on, Leonard. It\\u2019s too early for Lord of the Rings.\",\" I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.\",\" Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.\",\" He\\u2019s a musician. He\\u2019ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.\",\" Good luck catching a man with that attitude.\",\" His feelings needed to be hurt.\",\" Don\\u2019t ask me. A little elf did it.\",\" Fine. I\\u2019ll take him for shoes next Saturday.\",\" No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it.\",\" He always needs all the attention. He\\u2019s such a baby.\",\" Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine. \",\" What? I don\\u2019t want to do that.\",\" You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.\",\" Then what do you need?\",\" Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.\",\" You can\\u2019t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?\",\" Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?\",\" Then what do we do?\",\" Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?\",\" Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?\",\" Well, it\\u2019s not what I want to do.\",\" Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don\\u2019t help them set up their printer.\",\" Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.\",\" See, now I\\u2019m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?\",\" So what do you want to do now?\",\" Okay, let\\u2019s do it. You gonna make it?\",\" Is this all stuff you want me to try on?\",\" Oh, no. Oh, you don\\u2019t want to do that.\",\" If that\\u2019s what you want to do, yes.\",\" I was going to do that.\",\" No, I don\\u2019t want to do it. You can do it.\",\" Well, good, because that\\u2019s what I did.\",\" You don\\u2019t need to do that, it\\u2019s okay.\",\" It doesn\\u2019t matter. I\\u2019m not doing it.\",\" So, what do you want to do?\",\" Those things can still happen.\",\" I know exactly what we are gonna do.\",\" Okay, I don\\u2019t want this to turn into a fight.\",\" Yeah, well, that\\u2019s not really my big problem.\",\" Oh, there\\u2019s so much I want to change.\",\" You sure you want to do this?\",\" All right, I really didn\\u2019t want to do this, but\\u2026 here.\",\" You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let\\u2019s just see what else is on.\",\" You don\\u2019t have a problem with this, do you?\",\" Can you finish it later?\",\" What, that already happened?\",\" Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.\",\" You changed every word.\",\" I don\\u2019t think this is gonna work.\",\" Do or do not. There is no try.\",\" And then what?\",\" Yes. It\\u2019s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.\",\" Well what are you gonna do?\",\" No. No, come on, I want to do it.\",\" Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.\",\" Okay, good, \\u2019cause that\\u2019s what I want, too.\",\" All right, let\\u2019s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?\",\" This is actually gonna happen.\",\" Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.\",\" That\\u2019s weird.\",\" Oh, that\\u2019s awful.\",\" You do?\",\" Well, that sucks.\",\" Yeah, that sounds right.\",\" Does that change things?\",\" You were right. \",\" No. No, no, I do. I do. It\\u2019s just, I mean, it\\u2019s a really big step.\",\" That\\u2019s gross.\",\" It\\u2019s just so humiliating.\",\" It\\u2019s weird.\",\" No, they\\u2019re not.\",\" Yeah, you do that.\",\" Oh, that\\u2019s nothing.\",\" Yeah, it kind of does, huh?\",\" It does?\",\" I don\\u2019t, either.\",\" No, you don\\u2019t.\",\" Yeah, they\\u2019re very considerate that way.\",\" You do that?\",\" No that doesn\\u2019t sound right either.\",\" So it\\u2019s not really like that?\",\" Yeah, he does, but it\\u2019s not the same.\",\" I really do.\",\" No, it doesn\\u2019t.\",\" Yeah, it\\u2019s weird.\",\" It\\u2019s the same thing.\",\" Yeah, that\\u2019ll slow it down.\",\" You\\u2019re sure it\\u2019s not weird.\",\" You do?\",\" Oh, yeah. I\\u2019m so\\u2026 oh, that\\u2019s terrible.\",\" That\\u2019s not true.\",\" That\\u2019s a big deal.\",\" I don\\u2019t?\",\" Yes, I do.\",\" Does it really say that?\",\" It\\u2019s not funny.\",\" You\\u2019re right.\",\" No, you don\\u2019t.\",\" Oh. Well, you do.\",\" Okay, well, they sure as hell don\\u2019t say that.\",\" I do, too, but there\\u2019s not.\",\" No, I do, and that\\u2019s why I hid it.\",\" Can you?\",\" That\\u2019s true.\",\" Oh, that\\u2019s too bad.\",\" Is that a big deal?\",\" What\\u2019s that?\",\" What?\",\" Like what?\",\" What is your point?\",\" What? Here? Now?\",\" What?\",\" On what?\",\" What happened?\",\" Huh. What is this?\",\" What?\",\" Which is?\",\" Why?\",\" What\\u2019s this?\",\" What?\",\" Well, what is it?\",\" What?\",\" What?\",\" What? No, that\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m saying.\",\" What?\",\" What?\",\" What does that mean?\",\" What is that? What is that for?\",\" What?\",\" What?\",\" What?\",\" Why not?\",\" Why?\",\" Why not?\",\" About what?\",\" What?\",\" What?\",\" How?\",\" Well, why?\",\" What is this?\",\" What?\",\" What?\",\" What?\",\" What did he say?\",\" What are you talking about?\",\" What does that mean?\",\" What?\",\" What? Why not?\",\" What?\",\" And you promise you\\u2019re okay with everything from the car?\",\" Don\\u2019t worry, I won\\u2019t look. \",\" No, it\\u2019s not. I mean, what\\u2019s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here\\u2019s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here\\u2019s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.\",\" Well, why were you so angry?\",\" Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I\\u2019m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying.\",\" I don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re upset about. I\\u2019m the one who\\u2019s losing.\",\" Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.\",\" I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.\",\" Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn\\u2019t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.\",\" The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.\",\" So you\\u2019re not judging me?\",\" And I\\u2019m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don\\u2019t want to cry on a big screen like that.\",\" Come on, don\\u2019t look so sad. You never know what\\u2019s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.\",\" Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I\\u2019m the super villain Magneto.\",\" Sweetie, I\\u2019m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.\",\" Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn\\u2019t make sense to have both.\",\" Sorry about your car, by the way.\",\" I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!\",\" No, I\\u2019m dry. You\\u2019re a big crybaby, you start, I\\u2019ll join in.\",\" No, of course not. I just feel bad.\",\" Oh, don\\u2019t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.\",\" Well, um, I\\u2019m just a little thirsty.\",\" I wouldn\\u2019t be bored. Why would I be bored?\",\" Are you mad at me?\",\" Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.\",\" Sweetie, I know you\\u2019re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it\\u2019s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn\\u2019t your car.\",\" Yes, but I get car sick too, so\\u2026\",\" Exactly, except you don\\u2019t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?\",\" I got you a little something to cheer you up.\",\" Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice.\",\" No, don\\u2019t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.\",\" No, I\\u2019m sorry. I really am. It\\u2019s not right to mock what a person believes in.\",\" Come on, don\\u2019t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.\",\" Well, this is silly, so you don\\u2019t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.\",\" You know what the saddest part was?\",\" Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.\",\" I am not a crybaby.\",\" Okay, now, what I\\u2019m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I\\u2019d be more succinct.\",\" Why are you yelling at me?\",\" Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I\\u2019m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.\",\" I feel like I want to cry.\",\" I know. You think people are gonna be mad?\",\" Stop it, you\\u2019re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.\",\" Yes.\",\" That a problem?\",\" Yeah. You got a problem with that?\",\" Yeah. This is crazy.\",\" Yes.\",\" Yeah.\",\" Totally.\",\" Yes. Thank you.\",\" Yes.\",\" Yeah, a couple.\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yeah?\",\" Yes.\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yeah?\",\" Yes?\",\" Yes.\",\" Yeah. Although\\u2026\",\" Yep.\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yep. What\\u2019s the code?\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yup.\",\" Here?\",\" Absolutely.\",\" Yeah?\",\" So?\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yes.\",\" Yeah. Oh. Here\\u2019s my list for you, right there.\",\" Yeah?\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yeah?\",\" Yeah.\",\" Yeah.\",\" Okay, um, well, there was this girl.\",\" No, but that\\u2019s okay. I\\u2019ll go talk to her. Want to come with?\",\" Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.\",\" Oh, the girls really did a nice job.\",\" Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.\",\" Um, little bit. (She looks at her watch) What?\",\" What about her?\",\" She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.\",\" She\\u2019s a delightful woman. You\\u2019ll love her.\",\" She let me.\",\" You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?\",\" Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.\",\" Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.\",\" I just said why, we don\\u2019t like her.\",\" Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.\",\" So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?\",\" Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I\\u2019ll go do that. Thank you.\",\" Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?\",\" I met this girl, and she\\u2019s great. We have a lot in common.\",\" I don\\u2019t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?\",\" What do you mean, every time you see her?\",\" So, who\\u2019s the girl?\",\" You can\\u2019t let her get into your head.\",\" You\\u2019re not curious who she\\u2019s out with?\",\" And she likes you.\",\" You still see her?\",\" Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.\",\" Come on in. Wait, wait, she\\u2019s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?\",\" Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.\",\" So, who is she?\",\" Hey, look, then forget about her, let\\u2019s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.\",\" Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don\\u2019t like her.\",\" Did you feel guilty after kissing her?\",\" Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.\",\" Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.\",\" You work with her? How could you not tell me that?\",\" Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I\\u2019ve been half bombed ever since.\",\" Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there\\u2019s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension\\u2026\",\" That is a pencil sharpener.\",\" But you\\u2019re curious about aluminium cans? You\\u2019re a weird little guy.\",\" Wow, Hawking. Good for you.\",\" Yeah. It\\u2019s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I\\u2019ll show you. We\\u2019ll just put this pencil over here.\",\" I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.\",\" Oh, voodoo\\u2019s real. You don\\u2019t want to mess with voodoo.\",\" Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really (changes view to solar system) just be information (changes view to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. (Starts the galaxy spinning) So it\\u2019s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.\",\" Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?\",\" Okay, don\\u2019t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.\",\" No, no. People don\\u2019t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble\\u2026 This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.\",\" Anyway, Stephen Hawking\\u2019s team is looking into that, and I\\u2019ve been invited to join them.\",\" So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?\",\" You know, there\\u2019s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.\",\" No, no. It\\u2019s kind of crazy. I\\u2019ve never fooled around in the lab before.\",\" Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.\",\" Really, that\\u2019s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?\",\" You know, like, most of the time, you\\u2019re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!\",\" Uh, let\\u2019s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I\\u2019ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.\",\" On a ship? Aren\\u2019t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?\",\" Oh, no, no, no, crystals don\\u2019t work.\",\" What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh! Wow!\",\" Yeah, I listen to what you say. You\\u2019re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.\",\" Wow. High-techie-techie. What\\u2019s this little box?\",\" The problem isn\\u2019t what\\u2019s on the inside. It\\u2019s the creepy candy coating.\",\" Well, it\\u2019s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.\",\" I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.\",\" Oh, what a nice surprise. I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019ve ever seen my lab before.\",\" So, basically, this is what\\u2019s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.\",\" Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.\",\" Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.\",\" Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn\\u2019t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.\",\" Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.\",\" Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. (A floating 3D image of the pencil appears. Leonard moves it around with his finger)\",\" No, I do. I didn\\u2019t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.\",\" No, it\\u2019s a nitrogen laser. It\\u2019ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.\",\" Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?\",\" Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.\",\" Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.\",\" Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.\",\" You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I\\u2019m getting it.\",\" I don\\u2019t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.\",\" Oh, that\\u2019s nice, but it-it\\u2019s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I\\u2019m not sure how much help you\\u2019d be.\",\" Well, so do I, but don\\u2019t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it\\u2019s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?\",\" You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.\",\" All right, sweetie, you\\u2019re paying for this table, and it\\u2019s your apartment, too.\",\" You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.\",\" Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they\\u2019re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it\\u2019s just, like\\u2026 Why don\\u2019t you just get a roommate and stay here?\",\" Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.\",\" What? Are you kidding? We\\u2019re not hanging it.\",\" Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.\",\" Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brother\\u2019s coming out here in a few weeks.\",\" I don\\u2019t listen for it, but it\\u2019s nice to know everything\\u2019s okay with your plumbing. The building\\u2019s plumbing.\",\" Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Ca\\u00f1ada has some great schools.\",\" Well, you and I would get our own room, right?\",\" And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how\\u2019s the detector going?\",\" If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your\\u2026 your only tie?\",\" Is your brother out of prison?\",\" I\\u2019m sure we\\u2019ll find a decent chapel.\",\" Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work.\",\" Oh, come on, that\\u2019s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.\",\" And our butts. Not hanging it.\",\" Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What\\u2019s going on with your brother?\",\" So, where do we want to hang it?\",\" No, no, no, no, no, it\\u2019s, it\\u2019s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.\",\" Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven\\u2019t really made it yours.\",\" Of course not. I mean, he\\u2019s your brother.\",\" You hung in there, though.\",\" Oh, that is so thoughtful.\",\" Oh. Oh. Thank you.\",\" Whoa! That\\u2019s heavy.\",\" Ooh, this one looks nice.\",\" Oh, wow, that\\u2019s so sweet. Hey, what\\u2019s this?\",\" That\\u2019s great. That shows a lot of integrity.\",\" Yeah? That\\u2019s because you\\u2019re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.\",\" Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.\",\" Wow. That is amazing.\",\" This is great. It, thank you, it\\u2019s, so much.\",\" Wow. That\\u2019s rough.\",\" This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?\",\" It\\u2019s great. I love it.\",\" You\\u2019re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.\",\" It\\u2019s actually pretty neat.\",\" It is freaking amazing.\",\" Wow, where did you learn these moves?\",\" That one? Damn right I like that one.\",\" Wow, you remember that?\",\" Wow.\",\" Whoa! That is very cool.\",\" Oh, wow.\",\" You know what, that\\u2019s great. I love that.\",\" Oh, it\\u2019s beautiful.\",\" I liked it. I\\u2019m excited.\",\" Couple of weeks.\",\" I, I\\u2019m not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job, then who knows?\",\" Don\\u2019t worry, we won\\u2019t be doing much sleeping anyway. It\\u2019s like an all-night party. There\\u2019s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, it\\u2019s off the chain mail.\",\" Almost 1am.\",\" Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren\\u2019t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.\",\" It\\u2019s six thirty in the morning.\",\" Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it\\u2019s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.\",\" That sounds fun. When\\u2019s it start?\",\" When is it?\",\" Oh, before I forget, Saturday I\\u2019m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.\",\" A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.\",\" Three, four months.\",\" Whoa. When would you leave?\",\" Well, how long?\",\" Really? That\\u2019s how you\\u2019re gonna spend your Saturday night?\",\" Night.\",\" Well, the night is still young.\",\" Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.\",\" They\\u2019re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.\",\" Uh, Th, that\\u2019s true. How late did we stay up last night?\",\" Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?\",\" Midnight. Really? You know what? Let\\u2019s do it.\",\" Thirty feet.\",\" Midnight.\",\" He tried to take nude photos of you?\",\" Did he pay you back?\",\" Well, maybe you should tell him.\",\" Come on, trust me, he\\u2019s hitting on you.\",\" Relax. He\\u2019s just a friend. We\\u2019re doing an oral report together. He\\u2019s really nice.\",\" No, he\\u2019s not. We\\u2019re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he\\u2019s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.\",\" Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?\",\" Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?\",\" Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I\\u2019m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You\\u2019re not really considering working for him, are you?\",\" He can never know that I gave that to you.\",\" Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?\",\" Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.\",\" Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?\",\" No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.\",\" Did your boyfriend make you type that?\",\" Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.\",\" It\\u2019s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you\\u2019ve just met.\",\" Listen, don\\u2019t worry. I\\u2019ll talk to him.\",\" What? He loves you, okay? And he\\u2019s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective\\u2026 I swear I know it.\",\" Not only is he still not talking to me, but there\\u2019s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put\\u2019s fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, \\u201cI know my physics, but I\\u2019m still a fun guy!\\u201d\",\" Screw him. You\\u2019re fine.\",\" Yeah, probably.\",\" Yeah, of course, why?\",\" Sometimes.\",\" So what do you think?\",\" On the one hand, if I say yes\\u2026\",\" I would hope so.\",\" Of course.\",\" Um, I think so. Why?\",\" I guess.\",\" I don\\u2019t think so.\",\" I hope so.\",\" I guess.\",\" I guess not.\",\" Oh, I\\u2019ll probably say yes.\",\" Yeah, probably.\",\" Yeah, I think so.\",\" Maybe.\",\" Yeah, I guess.\",\" Yeah. I guess.\",\" No, but he will.\",\" It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.\",\" I know. Food fight. I\\u2019ll keep thinking.\",\" I did like that he had the weather on it.\",\" I know, but you did throw up. Isn\\u2019t that a sign of a concussion?\",\" He was drunk.\",\" Yeah, I don\\u2019t think the water was really boiling.\",\" It\\u2019s like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn\\u2019t want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.\",\" No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy\\u2019s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich\\u2019ed him.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry, I didn\\u2019t hear anything after lick.\",\" I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that\\u2019s it.\",\" You can hear my toilet flush?\",\" This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.\",\" The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.\",\" I\\u2019m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I\\u2019m gonna rock your world. (Penny vomits in sink) Are you okay? (Vomits in toilet again)\",\" This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn\\u2019t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.\",\" It was the heat of the moment.\",\" Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.\",\" Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.\",\" Really?\",\" Really?\",\" Really?\",\" Really? Here?\",\" Really? Never?\",\" Do you really mean that?\",\" Really? You guess you\\u2019re in?\",\" Really?\",\" Really?\",\" Really? This one?\",\" Really?\",\" Really?\",\" Really?\",\" Really? Why?\",\" Really?\",\" Really?\",\" Really? Why would you say that?\",\" Okay, whatever.\",\" Okay.\",\" Okay.\",\" Okay.\",\" Okay.\",\" Okay.\",\" Okay.\",\" Okay, I was just checking.\",\" Okay, I get it.\",\" Okay. Good.\",\" This is for you.\",\" Okay. Have fun.\",\" Well\\u2026\",\" Okay.\",\" Okay.\",\" Okay, like what?\",\" Okay.\",\" Hi.\",\" Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.\",\" Hi. \",\" Hi.\",\" Yes, please.\",\" Hi.\",\" I just thought I\\u2019d stop by and say hello.\",\" Hi.\",\" Oh, hi.\",\" Smile.\",\" Hi. Sure.\",\" Sure.\",\" Hi.\",\" Oh, hi.\",\" Sure.\",\" Sure.\",\" Sure.\",\" Hey.\",\" Hey.\",\" Hey.\",\" Both of us.\",\" Hey, you.\",\" Hey.\",\" Oh hey.\",\" Hey.\",\" Hey.\",\" Hey.\",\" Hey.\",\" Hey!\",\" Hey.\",\" Hey.\",\" Hey.\",\" Hey.\",\" Okay, I know you don\\u2019t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom\\u2019s book?\",\" Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?\",\" No, I can\\u2019t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we\\u2019d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.\",\" Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it\\u2019s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.\",\" It\\u2019s a first edition of Hitchhiker\\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.\",\" Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.\",\" No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.\",\" All right, hang on. is this still about your mom\\u2019s book?\",\" Seriously, please find another book.\",\" I\\u2019m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?\",\" No. Something\\u2019s going on. What\\u2019s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.\",\" Ugh, I should\\u2019ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.\",\" You bought my mom\\u2019s book?\",\" You know me, I\\u2019m a big ol\\u2019 bookworm.\",\" It\\u2019s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.\",\" Actually, you know what? I think it\\u2019s about time I pick a movie we see.\",\" Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.\",\" This is the movie that big soda doesn\\u2019t want you to see.\",\" Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.\",\" I don\\u2019t understand why we\\u2019re leaving so early for the movie.\",\" I hate those movies.\",\" Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.\",\" Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.\",\" Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she\\u2019s not building a dam.\",\" Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.\",\" It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.\",\" You pick plenty of movies.\",\" But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.\",\" So it\\u2019s a family film.\",\" No, it\\u2019s the movie your wife doesn\\u2019t want you to see.\",\" A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.\",\" I\\u2019m the one who thought of it.\",\" You saying I don\\u2019t have an open mind?\",\" You think about dying?\",\" I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn\\u2019t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.\",\" Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.\",\" I thought it\\u2019d be a little more, just more.\",\" You know, can I ask you a question?\",\" I was thinking here with you.\",\" You could be a little more into it.\",\" I just thought of one more.\",\" You\\u2019re overthinking this.\",\" I do have to ask you one favour.\",\" Are you out of your mind?!\",\" Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.\",\" Okay, Merry Christmas.\",\" Sorry, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m sorry! Never mind, we\\u2019re cool.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry?\",\" Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I\\u2019m sorry.\",\" It doesn\\u2019t matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.\",\" All right, well I\\u2019ll see you later.\",\" Okay, come with me.\",\" It\\u2019s okay.\",\" Wow. Oh, okay, well, I\\u2019ll just come visit you.\",\" You\\u2019re welcome, oh, you\\u2019re going to step right, okay, I\\u2019ll\\u2026.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry. Just, just give me another chance.\",\" Okay, really, I\\u2019m fine.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry, go ahead.\",\" It\\u2019s a little late, but I\\u2019ll take it.\",\" Oh, my God, that\\u2019s where I know you from.\",\" That is the sickest thing I\\u2019ve ever heard.\",\" Oh, my God.\",\" Oh, my God.\",\" Oh, my God.\",\" Oh, my God, yes.\",\" Oh, my God, you still go left.\",\" Oh, and the fairy tale continues.\",\" Oh, my God. What a day.\",\" Right there, right there, Oh, God, that\\u2019s it.\",\" Oh, God.\",\" Oh, my God. What happened?\",\" Oh, thank God.\",\" Oh, my God, I am the worst.\",\" No.\",\" No.\",\" Nope.\",\" No.\",\" Not really, no.\",\" No.\",\" No?\",\" Then no.\",\" No.\",\" No.\",\" No. Why?\",\" Nope.\",\" Nope, never.\",\" Sure, sure, just I don\\u2019t know much about football.\",\" No talking.\",\" You want to talk?\",\" So, you\\u2019re okay talking about this?\",\" Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don\\u2019t try and talk sports with the guys.\",\" Say, can\\u2019t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.\",\" Who you talking to?\",\" Oh, that\\u2019s excellent. It\\u2019s a weird figure of speech, isn\\u2019t it, we won when you weren\\u2019t\",\" Wait, if you guys didn\\u2019t talk, what did you\\u2026 never mind, stupid question.\",\" Okay, I don\\u2019t know where you\\u2019re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.\",\" Okay, that\\u2019s enough. Stop talking.\",\" See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.\",\" Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first. \",\" Thank you.\",\" Thank you. You look very nice.\",\" Thank you.\",\" Thank you. So do you. \",\" Nicely done.\",\" Thank you.\",\" Thanks.\",\" Thank you.\",\" Thank you.\",\" Oh. Done and done.\",\" Okay.

Go on.\",\" Come on, be serious.\",\" Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?\",\" I\\u2019m nosy. See ya.\",\" So you\\u2019re actually okay with invading your friend\\u2019s privacy?\",\" Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren\\u2019t geniuses. My point is, if we\\u2019re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.\",\" Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? \\u2018Cause you know, you and me\\u2026\",\" Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.\",\" Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?\",\" Oh, come on. Every time we\\u2019re about to hang out with my friends, you don\\u2019t want to. It\\u2019s like, It\\u2019s too loud, or the bathroom\\u2019s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean\\u2026\",\" No, I\\u2019m not shy.\",\" Oh, are you shy? \",\" Oh, that\\u2019s a good question. How about awkward?\",\" Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.\",\" That\\u2019s not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That\\u2019s all you.\",\" Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor\\u2019s black, so I\\u2019m pretty sure that\\u2019s the right answer.\",\" Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?\",\" So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?\",\" Oh, God. Stop. I don\\u2019t want you to read something you think\\u2019ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.\",\" It\\u2019s really good. We\\u2019ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.\",\" Aw, I got a little paper cut.\",\" Yeah. It\\u2019s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.\",\" Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.\",\" How can reading my journal be an accident?\",\" Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.\",\" Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?\",\" Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.\",\" Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?\",\" You did not just quote an Nsync song.\",\" Oh, sorry, yeah.

Gah?\",\" I\\u2019d love it if my dad could come.\",\" I\\u2019m glad to hear it.\",\" May what?\",\" Hey. You ready to go?\",\" Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.\",\" What\\u2019s two to one?\",\" So we don\\u2019t tell people we\\u2019re back together?\",\" Oh. \",\" That doesn\\u2019t seem to be where I shine.

Can they?\",\" Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?\",\" Did you just quote Star Wars?\",\" I told you not to do the worm.\",\" Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?\",\" Oh.\",\" Move out.\",\" Good, good. And then what?\",\" Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you\\u2019re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.\",\" Well, who\\u2019d you go with?\",\" A little mood lighting, huh?\",\" Oh, I don\\u2019t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?\",\" Little bit, yeah.\",\" Well, remember Kurt?\",\" You\\u2019re making it a big deal.\",\" That\\u2019s what you took from that? The guy is married!\",\" Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.\",\" You\\u2019re kidding.\",\" Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can\\u2019t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.\",\" Well, I\\u2019ve had it. I am done. I can\\u2019t, I can\\u2019t live with him for one more minute.\",\" It is, isn\\u2019t it?\",\" Mm, not really.\",\" The\\u2026 the eighth grade?\",\" So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.\",\" Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?\",\" No, no, I\\u2019m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven\\u2019t slept with any of your co-workers.\",\" Yeah, sorry.\",\" come on in.\",\" You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.\",\" It\\u2019s not working.\",\" Yeah, I guess you\\u2019re right.\",\" Uh, yeah.\",\" Who\\u2019s that?\",\" Why do you think I\\u2019d be like that? I get it, you\\u2019re taking one class. It\\u2019s nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.\",\" Fine, I\\u2019ll go over there tomorrow.\",\" Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.\",\" I\\u2019m okay.\",\" Sure you have.\",\" So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?\",\" You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?\",\" Oh, I know. This might help.\",\" Good night.\",\" Okay, well, that\\u2019s really cool of you.\",\" Well, how about if we don\\u2019t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it\\u2019s solid, then we\\u2019ll roll it out to the public.\",\" Well, uh, first of all, don\\u2019t underestimate the value of discomfort.\",\" Oh. Then I guess I\\u2019m in.\",\" Because I know how important it is to you that I\\u2019m having some success.\",\" Yeah, it was.\",\" So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?\",\" Aw, I know I wasn\\u2019t into this before, but I\\u2019m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.\",\" Well, that was fun.\",\" No, I\\u2019m not.\",\" I have feelings for you.\",\" Ooh.\",\" All right.\",\" I got your back.\",\" Smooth.\",\" No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.\",\" Not really.\",\" Well, good for you.\",\" It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.\",\" Well, when you realized what it was, why didn\\u2019t you stop?\",\" See, that\\u2019s the kind of passion I didn\\u2019t think I had. But then I realized I\\u2019m passionate about you.\",\" Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we\\u2019ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.\",\" Well, it\\u2019s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it\\u2019s meant to be, it\\u2019ll be.\",\" You two want to be alone?\",\" Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.\",\" Oh, nice. \",\" It\\u2019ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.\",\" Okay. There\\u2019s one not far from here. Come on. Let\\u2019s go.\",\" He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we\\u2019d be floating around in, he didn\\u2019t even question it.\",\" Nothing really. It was just kissing.\",\" She\\u2019d be proud, huh?\",\" I can\\u2019t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.\",\" That\\u2019d be great. Thank you.\",\" Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.\",\" Did you guys do it?\",\" And that\\u2019s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?\",\" I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?\",\" The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.\",\" Not like, I guess I\\u2019m in. Like I guess, I\\u2019m in!\",\" Yeah. Okay, all right, don\\u2019t freak out. You can make this work.\",\" Oh, God, no. The money\\u2019s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.\",\" Nevertheless, I\\u2019d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.\",\" Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.\",\" Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What\\u2019s, what\\u2019s that?\",\" It\\u2019s a lot cooler when girls aren\\u2019t looking at it.\",\" Oh, that\\u2019s okay, a lot of the guys\\u2019 girlfriends don\\u2019t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.\",\" Well, I have a secret I\\u2019ve been keeping from you, too.\",\" There we go.\",\" Yeah.

Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.\",\" TV star.\",\" Mmm.\",\" I can\\u2019t do it with you staring at me.\",\" Okay. Here goes.\",\" It is. It is about us.\",\" Well, we did it.\",\" Well, uh, the important thing is he\\u2019s married and that\\u2019s terrible!\",\" Okay, let\\u2019s go see your psychic.\",\" Well, you don\\u2019t know that.\",\" Why should I worry?\",\" Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I\\u2019m gonna go right. Don\\u2019t make a big deal out of it.\",\" That\\u2019s the thing, you can\\u2019t. I\\u2019ll be on a ship in the North Sea.\",\" So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn\\u2019t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.\",\" Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it\\u2019s all about?\",\" What if I dump you?\",\" No. We just made out a little.\",\" Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn\\u2019t have to be dating someone who\\u2019s only a waitress.\",\" They don\\u2019t, that\\u2019s why I saved this one. \",\" I don\\u2019t know, it\\u2019s complicated.\",\" Yeah. I got a dressmaker\\u2019s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.\",\" Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.\",\" Yeah, you got it.\",\" You\\u2019re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.\",\" And then the, the subject got changed somehow.\",\" Very funny.\",\" Well, it\\u2019s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.\",\" Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.\",\" What good is it if you don\\u2019t use it?\",\" So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.\",\" Right.\",\" It\\u2019s just the four digits, month and day.\",\" What?

I have sales experience, and I\\u2019ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he\\u2019s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.\",\" Get out.\",\" Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.\",\" I don\\u2019t want you to make a big deal out of it.\",\" I was just hungry and cranky, and I\\u2019ve never been called ma\\u2019am before.\",\" Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.\",\" I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.\",\" Having a little trouble catching your breath there?\",\" So, that sounds more like something you\\u2019d say if you didn\\u2019t want a relationship with someone. This isn\\u2019t working out, but I\\u2019ll always have feelings for you. I\\u2019m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I\\u2019ll always have feelings for you. Here\\u2019s the thing, Lisa, I\\u2019m into dudes now, but I\\u2019ll always have feelings for you.\",\" You used to it yet?\",\" \\u2018Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?\",\" Did not know that.\",\" So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.\",\" Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Here\\u2019s the hotel room we all share. \",\" Won\\u2019t make us any younger.\",\" Well, I don\\u2019t know how you have a relationship without talking.\",\" I\\u2019m not gonna schmooze anybody. I\\u2019m gonna let my work speak for itself.\",\" Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?\",\" What does it matter? The point is, I\\u2019m choosing you.\",\" You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.\",\" Is that a pregnancy test?\",\" Okay. (Reading) Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?\",\" Can I take a look?\",\" Trying to paint a picture.\",\" Why does it have to get weird?\",\" I\\u2019m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn\\u2019t mean to!\",\" Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.\",\" Sorry. Maybe next year. I\\u2019m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let\\u2019s have sex. Waugh!\",\" Yeah, bitches are the worst.\",\" You\\u2019re kidding, right?\",\" Oh. That\\u2019s great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?\",\" Oh, don\\u2019t say cute. That\\u2019s the worst.\",\" Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.\",\" No, I meant that as a regret.\",\" Great.\",\" Oh, thank you, but I\\u2019m okay.\",\" Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.\",\" Uh.\",\" Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.\",\" Can\\u2019t argue with that. I\\u2019ll get the tickets.\",\" This is just something you usually do together, and if I\\u2019m screwing it up, I don\\u2019t have to go.\",\" You mean, like a pinky swear?\",\" Yeah, that\\u2019s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I\\u2019ve got some good news.\",\" Well, it just wasn\\u2019t the right time.\",\" Hmm?\",\" That\\u2019s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?\",\" Right. Sorry.\",\" No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.\",\" Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it\\u2019s sold out.\",\" You\\u2019re a good friend.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry, I was thinking about work.\",\" Oh. Well, that\\u2019s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.\",\" Yeah, I\\u2019m familiar with Bert and Ernie.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry, but I\\u2019m gonna count that.\",\" Some sports bar. It\\u2019s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?\",\" Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?\",\" Look, I\\u2019m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren\\u2019t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.\",\" That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I\\u2019m gonna show you how much this means to me.\",\" Right. Sorry, sorry.\",\" I don\\u2019t care. We\\u2019ll make our own music.\",\" Oh, no, no, no, don\\u2019t look in there.\",\" Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn\\u2019t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron\\u2019s sister?\",\" Well, it is. Just, you know, I\\u2019d be gone for a while.\",\" Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.\",\" Because you are giving your commencement speech.\",\" Just open it.\",\" No. Look, this has to stop.\",\" You know what, why don\\u2019t you just do it? You\\u2019ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?\",\" It\\u2019s not what we planned, but this isn\\u2019t so bad, right?\",\" Well, it\\u2019s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.\",\" Great.\",\" Yeah, there is.\",\" It\\u2019s open.\",\" Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would\\u2019ve asked you to dance.\",\" It\\u2019s too late for me. My head is her summer house.\",\" Well, that is the grown-up thing.\",\" No. Sulfites. Migraines.\",\" You don\\u2019t know my birthday, do you?\",\" Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.\",\" You\\u2019re closer to 40 than you are 30.\",\" Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?\",\" I made an eight o\\u2019clock reservation.\",\" Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.\",\" No, no, I\\u2019m okay, it\\u2019s stopped bleeding.\",\" So, Polly, tell me about yourself.\",\" Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.\",\" Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don\\u2019t want you to be uncomfortable. \",\" Oh, hey.\",\" Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?\",\" See? Right there. You\\u2019re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn\\u2019t, but one problem at a time.\",\" How did you get paint in your eye?\",\" Fine. You think you know so much. Who\\u2019s my favourite Spice Girl?\",\" Hey, you got a minute?\",\" Mm-hmm.\",\" Oh, there\\u2019s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.\",\" D-don\\u2019t be silly. We\\u2019re neighbours, we\\u2019re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.\",\" Baby.\",\" You know I want to marry you, but you\\u2019re only doing this because you got fired and you\\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself.\",\" Oh, that means so much. I love you.\",\" Let\\u2019s see. What\\u2019s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.\",\" Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That\\u2019s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.\",\" Good. Glad is good.\",\" Sweetie, you are grown up.\",\" I know, but\\u2026\",\" Well, get it. Get it for me.\",\" Joke all you want, but you think about it.\",\" Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?\",\" You okay? You seem a little distracted.\",\" Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it\\u2019s good to open up about these things.\",\" No, I\\u2019m into it, I\\u2019m into it. Just, there\\u2019s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.\",\" This would have been so much more romantic if you didn\\u2019t have monkey hair on your finger.\",\" Okay, now this time\\u2026\",\" You\\u2019re right. Just forget it.\",\" Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart\\u2019s comic book store. Is that okay?\",\" My God, who\\u2019s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.\",\" Come here.\",\" Well, didn\\u2019t he do a lot of the work?\",\" What makes you think I didn\\u2019t go to my prom? I went.\",\" Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn\\u2019t.\",\" Why? What are you afraid of?\",\" Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that\\u2019s why he works in a comic book store.\",\" Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he\\u2019s dating someone, but he\\u2019s not because, in fact, you\\u2019re dating her, does that make you a bad person?\",\" I didn\\u2019t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.\",\" Inevitable, you say?\",\" What else can you do? Move back in with him?\",\" Yeah, I wanted to explain.\",\" Oh, okay, it\\u2019s not important. It can wait.\",\" Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.\",\" I know, I know.\",\" Hey, if you\\u2019re pausing for dramatic effect, I\\u2019d keep it moving.\",\" You\\u2019ll never believe what happened to me at work today.\",\" Nice.\",\" She\\u2019s only been here a day and a half and I\\u2019m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.\",\" Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.\",\" It\\u2019s okay if you say no.\",\" Hmm.\",\" Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It\\u2019s where all the vendors and exhibits are.\",\" I love you, too.\",\" I turn into a bear?\",\" I don\\u2019t know.\",\" Well, there was a lot at stake.\",\" Yeah, I know, it\\u2019s just, this wasn\\u2019t the plan, it wasn\\u2019t supposed to go this way.\",\" No. He can\\u2019t afford his apartment, and he\\u2019s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean.\",\" Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.\",\" What, is it secret?\",\" Oh, good, you heard me.\",\" The one I gave you?\",\" I have a confession to make.\",\" Oh, um, I, I can come back.\",\" You\\u2019re a hero.\",\" Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.\",\" Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.\",\" No, I don\\u2019t want there to be secrets between us.\",\" Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.\",\" Nice try. NSYNC forever.\",\" Great. I\\u2019ll go get my stuff.\",\" I love you, too.\",\" Aw.\",\" Can I get you anything?\",\" Thank you. Finally, there\\u2019s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn\\u2019t disappointed in me.\",null,\" Hey, you got a minute?\",\" Well, come on, he\\u2019s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He\\u2019s fine.\",\" Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.\",\" \\u2018Cause if you\\u2019re still upset about that, we don\\u2019t have to go.\",\" What did you do?\",\" Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?\",\" Honestly? It\\u2019s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it\\u2019s not like we have a lot to talk about.\",\" How about that? I finally caught a break.\",\" All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it\\u2019s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I\\u2019m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it\\u2019s right here.\",\" Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?\",\" No, I know. It\\u2019s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.\",\" I hate this guy.\",\" Over puppets?\",\" I can\\u2019t believe you saved all this stuff.\",\" You know, there\\u2019s nothing wrong helping some woman\\u2019s kid get through their S.A.T.\\u2019s.\",\" No. That\\u2019s not true. There\\u2019s French, there\\u2019s Italian. No, you\\u2019re right, it\\u2019s the best.\",\" Did she think you were choking or\\u2026 I\\u2019m sorry, that\\u2019s great. Thank you for spending time with her.\",\" You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn\\u2019t want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.\",\" I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.\",\" Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.\",\" Hey. Penny, don\\u2019t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.\",\" Good morning, sunshine.\",\" What about my robot poster?\",\" Of course not.\",\" No, no that\\u2019s the past. I\\u2019m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, \\u2019cause, well, that\\u2019s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn\\u2019t bother me.\",\" Oh. Yeah, okay.\",\" What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fianc\\u00e9 ever?\",\" In confidence!\",\" Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let\\u2019s do something fun tonight.\",\" Okay. I\\u2019ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.\",\" Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?\",\" Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.\",\" Yeah, don\\u2019t let Goofy near him. He\\u2019ll have nightmares and I\\u2019ll have to deal with it.\",\" My last growth spurt. \",\" What do you want from me?\",\" My head, what about yours?\",\" All I\\u2019m saying is give me a heads-up.\",\" Okay, you\\u2019re kind of really great.\",\" You don\\u2019t know your own husband\\u2019s birthday.\",\" Oh, cool. Are there pictures?\",\" Was there a plan B?\",\" You\\u2019re kidding.\",\" Telephone wires can\\u2019t electrocute you, can they?\",\" Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.\",\" You had sex, didn\\u2019t you?\",\" Yeah. You\\u2019re gonna be on Skype, they\\u2019re not gonna see your legs.\",\" Okay, well, let\\u2019s just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.\",\" Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.\",\" I know. I feel so grown up.\",\" One of them\\u2019s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.\",\" Spaghetti okay?\",\" In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.\",\" Sorry. Whatever. It\\u2019s all good.\",\" Did you get the part?\",\" Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.\",\" What are you worried about?\",\" Who\\u2019s my favorite member of NSYNC?\",\" You know what, you don\\u2019t have to give me this. You keep it.\",\" You, you stupid Pop-Tart.\",\" Oh.\",\" Good. Because I\\u2019ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.\",\" Sorry.\",\" Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?\",\" Face it, you can\\u2019t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don\\u2019t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine\\u2019s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know\\u2026\",\" Well, I am.\",\" Yeah, kind of, yeah.\",\" Huh? If you think that\\u2019s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?\",\" Well, then have the robot go and get him.\",\" Mm. Well, I think more about if I\\u2019d have any regrets.\",\" What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?\",\" We gotta get her to a vet right now.\",\" I know you won\\u2019t look, why would you look, there\\u2019s nothing to see, well, not nothing\\u2026.\",\" With your career?\",\" Hmm.\",\" Okay, you\\u2019re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.\",\" Okay, at some point, we\\u2019ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don\\u2019t we just start doing that now?\",\" Okay, it\\u2019s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.\",\" Smoother than you.\",\" And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.\",\" I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.\",\" Huh.\",\" So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.\",\" It\\u2019s open.\",\" Oh, my. It\\u2019s not a contest.\",\" Great, and just so you know, I\\u2019m not getting rid of all your stuff.\",\" Control issues?\",\" I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn\\u2019t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.\",\" You sure?\",\" I got asked to sign autographs there.\",\" And stop apologizing all the time.\",\" No. I need to start making some smart decisions.\",\" Well, yeah.\",\" Uh-huh. \",\" Well, I can\\u2019t believe you\\u2019d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.\",\" You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?\",\" Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn\\u2019t really know anybody.\",\" Hmm.\",\" Yes, you don\\u2019t always have to go along with what the woman wants.\",\" Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?\",\" I\\u2019m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?\",\" Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?\",\" I quoted your favourite Nsync song.\",\" I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking\",\" No, no, it\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s really thoughtful.\",\" Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.\",\" You know, sometimes I think I\\u2019ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.\",\" Gee, I don\\u2019t know. Maybe it\\u2019s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I\\u2019d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.\",\" Uh-huh.\",\" So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?\",\" Are you sure?\",\" Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.\",\" Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.\",\" Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?\",\" Oh, rose petals.\",\" Look, I don\\u2019t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I\\u2019m already worried about.\",\" You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.\",\" I love you.\",\" Huh.\",\" I don\\u2019t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You\\u2019d think I\\u2019d have a vet.\",\" Yeah, me, too.\",\" Hmm?\",\" Oh, what a jerk.\",\" I\\u2019m dealing with a situation and it\\u2019s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.\",\" Uh-huh.\",\" You\\u2019ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don\\u2019t love that, this marriage is in trouble.\",\" You are so funny.\",\" No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.\",\" Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.\",\" No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don\\u2019t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It\\u2019s not easy. You try it.\",\" All the time.\",\" Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?\",\" What\\u2019s wrong with cute?\",\" Oh, that\\u2019s not who I am.\",\" You wanted to meet my friends.\",\" Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you\\u2019ll see why.\",\" Well, can we get on another airline?\",\" I don\\u2019t know.\",\" Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here\\u2019s the thing, I\\u2019m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she\\u2019ll just dump me.\",\" Oh, yeah.\",\" Oh, I don\\u2019t know. Who cares? Look at me.\",\" Who\\u2019s my favorite Backstreet Boy?\",\" He\\u2019s not with a\\u2026 does it really matter who or what he\\u2019s with? The guy is devastated.\",\" Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?\",\" Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?\",\" Yeah. It\\u2019s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it\\u2019s fine, it\\u2019s great.\",\" Aw, is this your first time?\",\" Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?\",\" See? Now, that\\u2019s the great thing. We\\u2019re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let\\u2019s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.\",\" All right.\",\" Good, good. You?\",\" Oh, no, it\\u2019s fine, you got most of it out the window. \",\" All right, fine.\",\" Damn it.\",\" Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn\\u2019t speak again until middle school.\",\" Are you sure?\",\" That\\u2019s great.\",\" No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.\",\" Well, I don\\u2019t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.\",\" Yeah, sure, come on in.\",\" Oh, she\\u2019s a doctor.\",\" You\\u2019re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.\",\" Okay, great. Well, then why don\\u2019t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.\",\" Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.\",\" No, I don\\u2019t need any fish nibbling my business.\",\" The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.\",\" Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won\\u2019t get mad. I don\\u2019t like it after sex, and I don\\u2019t like it now.\",\" So, tell me about your day, how\\u2019s it going with the particle detector?\",\" Why does it have to be about anything? Can\\u2019t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?\",\" Uh.\",\" Oh, yeah, no, I, I\\u2019m, I\\u2019m glad.\",\" What\\u2019s the problem with Goofy?\",\" Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.\",\" Yes. We\\u2019ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I\\u2019m not doing that either. (Receives text) Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight\\u2019s been cancelled.\",\" You\\u2019re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can\\u2019t both have Frodo, so guess who\\u2019s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.\",\" Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think they\\u2019ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?\",\" Oh, well, then you, you do it.\",\" I\\u2019m really starting to think there\\u2019s a double standard here.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry I called it cute. Let\\u2019s watch another one.\",\" Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.\",\" Oh, pthththth.\",\" It was cute.\",\" Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.\",\" \\u202dYeah. It\\u2019s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?\",\" Please don\\u2019t be upset. I just, I didn\\u2019t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.\",\" I was hoping we could talk about the money again.\",\" No, I know you\\u2019ll try, but it\\u2019ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I\\u2019m just gonna stay where I\\u2019m at for now.\",\" And it\\u2019s the happiest day of our lives.\",\" A hugging machine?\",\" Okay. Thank you, you\\u2019re the best. Mm.\",\" Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.\",\" They have them every week.\",\" Uh-huh.\",\" Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.\",\" Ha, I knew you weren\\u2019t asleep.\",\" Okay, let\\u2019s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend\\u2019s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said\\u2026 what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.\",\" Wow.\",\" Really? Are you sure about that?\",\" Well, do you know anybody?\",\" I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.\",\" Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.\",\" Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?\",\" Toy Story 3?\",\" Really? What is the craziest thing you\\u2019ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.\",\" Is there any scenario where we\\u2019re not in full body paint?\",\" Are you sure? I could pretend I\\u2019m a high school cheerleader who can\\u2019t control herself around esteemed alumni.\",\" What do I mean? Boy, that\\u2019s a toughie.\",\" Oh, sweetie, if you\\u2019re gonna screw things up, it\\u2019s gonna be while you\\u2019re here, not while you\\u2019re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I\\u2019m just basing that on how much I didn\\u2019t understand what you said about it.\",\" It wasn\\u2019t even very good. She was a smoker, I\\u2019d just been seasick.\",\" I can\\u2019t believe you kept this.\",\" You\\u2019re kidding.\",\" By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.\",\" No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.\",\" Doesn\\u2019t sound that bad.\",\" She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.\",\" Oh, great. We\\u2019re still dating, right?\",\" Well, glad you\\u2019re feeling better.\",\" The robot didn\\u2019t hurt his feelings.\",\" Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone\\u2019s ever said to me.\",\" And I really appreciate it, but now I don\\u2019t need it, so here you go.\",\" What would you regret?\",\" I\\u2019m not saying that.\",\" All right, cool. I think you\\u2019ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.\",\" I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.\",\" Oh, come on Leonard, it\\u2019s you. What\\u2019s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you\\u2019d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.\",\" What if they call our names?\",\" Why? Because I\\u2019m a, a smart decision?\",\" Yeah, I know. I\\u2019m a total bitch.\",\" There\\u2019s no music.\",\" Hmm?\",\" The Harmony One was fine. We didn\\u2019t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.\",\" Wow. Well done.\",\" Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.\",\" I need you to apologize to How\\u2026\",\" Maybe. But this isn\\u2019t about them, it\\u2019s about us.\",\" It\\u2019s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it\\u2019s different.\",\" I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.\",\" Of course she did. Anyway, that\\u2019s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.\",\" That candle and you.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry, what did I say?\",\" Great, be right back.\",\" Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?\",\" That sounds like fun.\",\" Well, that depends.\",\" I guess it wouldn\\u2019t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.\",\" No, it\\u2019s not. Always made it worse.\",\" The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.\",\" Well, I\\u2019m sure he\\u2019ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he\\u2019ll stay?\",\" God, I love you. I love you so much.\",\" Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?\",\" Are you sure you don\\u2019t want to go to the emergency room?\",\" You\\u2019re right. I\\u2019m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?\",\" Yeah, that scares me, too.\",\" I am.\",\" I\\u2019m listening.\",\" No, it\\u2019s, it\\u2019s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send \\u2019em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.\",\" I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.\",\" Yeah, but it\\u2019s not pathetic, that\\u2019s where I draw the line. Come on, we\\u2019ll have fun.\",\" Good. (He grabs her and kisses her.) \",\" Fine, you win. You\\u2019re a bitch. Why couldn\\u2019t we just have a nice time?\",\" Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.\",\" Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it\\u2019s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie.\",\" Uh, keep your mouth off other women.\",\" Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.\",\" Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?\",\" So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?\",\" I know.\",\" Oh, good, I guessed right.\",\" Okay, good night, sweetie.\",\" Come on, it\\u2019s Christmas, just give me this one.\",\" I\\u2019m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?\",\" So you\\u2019ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?\",\" Another football game?\",\" Me, too.\",\" I don\\u2019t understand.\",\" Yes, you are. You always overthink things.\",\" Are you sure? That doesn\\u2019t sound right.\",\" You\\u2019re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?\",\" What? I didn\\u2019t know you had a journal.\",\" No. No woman would.\",\" I\\u2019m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.\",\" My birthday.\",\" Really? That\\u2019s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.\",\" It\\u2019ll be fine, let\\u2019s just go.\",\" About Stuart? Love to.\",\" Leonard, you\\u2019re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.\",\" Oh, you have to invite him. I haven\\u2019t seen him since the divorce.\",\" Seems a shame to throw it away.\",\" Well, then who?\",\" It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.\",\" Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.\",\" He\\u2019s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?\",\" Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.\",\" I\\u2019ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I\\u2019m pretty sure I know why.\",\" Well, I don\\u2019t know. It\\u2019s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn\\u2019t that make you a little jealous?\",\" Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don\\u2019t even know what TJ stands for.\",\" No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.\",\" Yeah, that was the point of the story.\",\" Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.\",\" I\\u2019ll just let my hips do the talkin\\u2019.\",\" Great.\",\" Oh, just this guy I met at school.\",\" I know. I thought we\\u2019d take yours.\",\" Okay, listen, there\\u2019s something I need to tell you. I\\u2019ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.\",\" That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?\",\" I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.\",\" Uh-huh.\",\" That is not the definition of professional.\",\" No, she doesn\\u2019t.\",\" Mm.\",\" Oh, yeah, sure. There\\u2019s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.\",\" Well, it creeps me out.\",\" Well, you didn\\u2019t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.\",\" Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.\",\" I thought you grew up on a farm.\",\" I know, and I\\u2019m proud of you, but that doesn\\u2019t mean I can\\u2019t do something nice. Like this.\",\" No, this is stuff I want you to throw out. \",\" I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.\",\" Well, um, on one level, really, really well.\",\" No, stop being stupid.\",\" Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.\",\" I\\u2019m sorry. I was just trying to help.\",\" Sure, anything.\",\" No, no, no, no, you\\u2019re, you\\u2019re unhappy there and then you\\u2019re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it\\u2019s fine, I\\u2019ll just, I\\u2019ll suck it up.\",\" Well, what was the plan?\",\" Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.\",\" I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.\",\" Even during? \\u2018Cause sometimes I have questions.\",\" Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?\",\" I don\\u2019t understand.\",\" Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.\",\" Short and sexy, that\\u2019s my wheelhouse.\",\" Oh that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s fine. Go ahead.\",\" Okay, uh, well, I hope it\\u2019s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it\\u2019s kind of creative and artistic.\",\" Mm-hmm. Hmm.\",\" Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.\",\" Aaargh.\",\" Oh, yes.\",\" Did they make a movie about it?\",\" Well, for starters, I wouldn\\u2019t eat the bananas.\",\" Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.\",\" Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?\",\" Well, have fun tonight.\",\" Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don\\u2019t you stop me?\",\" How long have you had this secret account?\",\" Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.\",\" Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?\",\" See, that wasn\\u2019t so bad. He even picked up the check.\",\" I can\\u2019t say.\",\" No, she had dental insurance.\",\" Well, how much you got in there?\",\" Oh, would you stop worrying about that?\",\" Well, you know, I just noticed I haven\\u2019t really met any of them.\",\" Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.\",\" You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?\",\" Hit me.\",\" May.\",\" I also know your voice gets higher when you\\u2019re lying.\",\" Are you really that kind of guy?\",\" Get out!\",\" There, there\\u2019s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don\\u2019t talk to me about it.\",\" Oh, that is so sad.\",\" Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.\",\" You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman. \",\" Yeah. You get the paint, I\\u2019ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.\",\" Yeah. Okay, listen. If you\\u2019re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn\\u2019t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.\",\" You know, I believe in ghosts, too.\",\" You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I\\u2019ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.\",\" I\\u2019m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.\",\" My father used to borrow it.\",\" That sounds nice. Yeah.\",\" The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.\",\" Hey, you got a sec?\",\" You\\u2019re so butch.\",\" I know. Thank you.\",\" Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.\",\" Well, you\\u2019re, you\\u2019re right. Let\\u2019s just go.\",\" I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.\",\" Sign right there.\",\" All right. Let\\u2019s just finish cooking.\",\" Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.\",\" I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.\",\" With my life.\",\" Okay, but earlier it seemed like\\u2026\",\" It\\u2019s just such a big decision. I don\\u2019t want to have any regrets.\",\" Sorry.\",\" You said always. You\\u2019ll always have feelings for me.\",\" We sure did.\",\" I\\u2019ve never been to a funeral before.\",\" Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it\\u2019s crazy. Where did all that time go?\",\" So, what did you think of your first funeral?\",\" Okay, well, this time it\\u2019s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don\\u2019t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!\",\" Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?\",\" Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.\",\" Okay, I\\u2019m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?\",\" I don\\u2019t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.\",\" And no regrets.\",\" And that\\u2019s why you get an iPad helicopter.\",\" No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn\\u2019t long enough.\",\" My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.\",\" No, it\\u2019s like that. Well, I\\u2019m excited to show you around.\",\" That sounds nice.\",\" Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade. \",\" Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn\\u2019t save them all.\",\" Really? \\u2018Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.\",\" Just kissing.\",\" Oh, then you all can get tenure.\",\" Yeah, I didn\\u2019t have any quarters, so I\\u2019ve been sneaking stuff into other people\\u2019s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?\",\" To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses.

Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?\",\" Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.\",\" No, the pants that Stephanie got me.\",\" A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?\",\" Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?\",\" Oh, hey, I didn\\u2019t know they still made corduroy suits!\",\" Why did you need a belt?\",\" Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.\",\" You don\\u2019t wanna wash that.\",\" Here, why don\\u2019t you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match. \",\" Yeah.
